Notes on the problem

The only tricky thing here is the creation of some function, which will check whether the current letter is vowel or not. You should not do something like this:

if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'e'
    || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o'
      || ch == 'u' || ch == 'y'
        || ch == 'A' || ch == 'E'
          || ch == 'I' || ch == 'O'
            || ch == 'U' || ch == 'Y')
Instead of such a long logical expression we'd better do the following:

Convert the letter to the lower case (if it is in upper case) - or convert the whole string beforehand to avoid checking for different cases.
Check whether the letter is presented in a string "aeiouy" - for example in C/C++ it could be done with

if (strchr("aeiouy", ch) != NULL) ...
This allows significantly reduce and simplify the code.
