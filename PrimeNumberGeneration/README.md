[Prime Number Generation](https://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/prime-numbers-generation)

Input data will contain the amount of primes to print in the first line.
Next line will contain indices of array of primes for which values should be printed. They will be in range from 1 to 200000.
Answer should contain prime numbers corresponding the specified positions of the array.

Note that for this task we start indexing an array from 1 rather than 0 (this may help you in checking your program with many lists of primes which could be found online).
