#Problem Statement
You will be given several numbers (not very large, so do not be afraid) to decompose them into products of primes.

Input data will contain amount of integers to factorize in the first line.
Next lines will contain one integer each (not exceeding 13 digits in length).
Answer should contain product representation for each of these integers, written like p1*p2*p3 where p1 ... p3 are some primes sorted in non-decreasing order. Products should be separated with spaces.
